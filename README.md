# Angular Internship at Nest 

## I completed an on-site internship at Nest, where I gained hands-on experience in Angular development. During the internship, I worked on building responsive UI components, integrating APIs with backend systems, and ensuring application reliability through bug fixes and unit tests. I utilized tools and technologies such as Angular CLI, RxJS, and TypeScript, and collaborated with the team in an Agile environment.  

## Several projects were completed during this period, all of which are included in this repository. These projects applied modern web development practices to deliver high-quality solutions. This experience significantly enhanced my understanding of Angular components, services, routing, and debugging, enabling me to contribute effectively to the team's goals. I am grateful for the mentorship and guidance provided by the Nest team throughout the internship.
